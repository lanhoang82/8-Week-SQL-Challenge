Danny, the CEO of this trendy fashion company has asked you to assist the team’s merchandising teams analyse their sales performance and generate a basic financial report to share with the wider business.

## Entity Relationship Diagram


For this case study there is a total of 4 datasets for this case study - however I will only need to utilise 2 main tables to solve all of the regular questions, and the additional 2 tables are used only for the bonus challenge question!

## Business Questions and Solutions via SQL Codes

The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.
