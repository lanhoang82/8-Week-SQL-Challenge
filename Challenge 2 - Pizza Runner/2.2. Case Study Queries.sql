/*					Case Study Questions
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

1. Pizza Metrics
2. Runner and Customer Experience
3. Ingredient Optimisation
4. Pricing and Ratings
5. Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

There are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones youâ€™d like to try!

Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want 
to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders 
tables!*/

/*C. Ingredient Optimisation
1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
3. What was the most common exclusion?
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
	a. Meat Lovers
	b. Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
	c. Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
	d. Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the 
customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
6.What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

D. Pricing and Ratings
1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - 
how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
	a. Add cheese is $1 extra
3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their 
runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table 
and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which 
has the following information for successful deliveries?
	a. customer_id
	b. order_id
	c. runner_id
	d. rating
	e. order_time
	f. pickup_time
	g. Time between order and pickup
	h. Delivery duration
	i. Average speed
	j. Total number of pizzas
5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

E. Bonus Questions
If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?*/
